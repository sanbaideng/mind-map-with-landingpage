What is a mind map?
-------------------

A mind map shows the different ideas associated with a particular concept. It is a useful tool for brainstorming. The concept is usually shown in the middle as a central idea that branches off in different directions. So, what is mind mapping? It’s simply the process of creating mind maps. Mind mapping involves brainstorming to document the relationships of information based on a single concept, then placing those ideas onto the mind map itself.

Why use mind maps?

![Image 41: mindmapping 01 social media strategies product image EN standard 4 3 2x](https://images.ctfassets.net/w6r2i5d8q73s/6Ku4dIXRkJRWOgM7CJAJQN/400ff0082724d3eb96f8ec01068b30b9/mindmapping_01_social_media_strategies_product_image_EN_standard_4_3_2x.png?fm=webp&q=75)

### Break down complex problems with ease

Our mind map maker grows with your thinking, letting you untangle challenges with alternative solutions.

![Image 42: mindmapping_02_product_image_EN_standard_4_3_2x.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/w6r2i5d8q73s/3zIjdlsd7fP6siNtZN0joZ/022a660df7b89fb8c28dafb977b6a85c/mindmapping_02_product_image_EN_standard_4_3_2x.png?fm=webp&q=75)

### Customize your mind map for a professional look

Whether you’re prepping a pitch or planning a team meeting, your mind map will look polished and professional.

![Image 43: mindmapping_03_agile_practice_product_image_EN_standard_4_3_2x.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/w6r2i5d8q73s/GZ6hM9avZvRbr05T5uPCS/81994b37a4d6df8aa03cbe555e5dac6e/mindmapping_03_agile_practice_product_image_EN_standard_4_3_2x.png?fm=webp&q=75)

Why use Miro's mind mapping tool?
---------------------------------

#### Presentation mode and Talktrack

Mind maps can be tricky to present - screenshots flatten them, and slides miss the flow. With Miro, you can turn your map into a compelling story. Toggle into presentation mode to frame sections of your mind map for easier storytelling or record a [Talktrack](https://miro.com/talktrack/) to guide your viewers with your voice and cursor. You can even record interactive videos to share with your team.

#### Easily share

Sharing mind maps shouldn’t be a hassle. Instead of relying on static screenshots or buried attachments, Miro makes it easy to keep everyone aligned.Export it as a PDF or image, invite collaborators with a link, or embed your mind map directly into tools like [Confluence](https://miro.com/marketplace/confluence/), Notion, and [Teams](https://miro.com/marketplace/microsoft-teams/) for seamless distribution.

#### Real-time and async collaboration

Distributed teams often face scattered conversations and missed input. Miro brings everyone into the same space - whether you’re online together or contributing later. Co-create your mind map with multiple team members in one space, tag each other in comments to start meaningful discussions, or use [sticky notes](https://miro.com/online-sticky-notes/) so no idea gets left behind..

#### Infinite canvas

Most mind mapping tools box you in, forcing you to trim ideas or scatter them across files. With Miro, you can grow your ideas without limits with our infinite canvas. Start with a central idea and branch out endlessly without worrying about space or layout constraints. You can also add important content to the same board — including spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more.

How to create a mind map with Miro
----------------------------------

### 1. Select the Mind Map app

[](https://miro.com/mind-map/#)

To get started with your mind map, open your Miro board and find the mind map tool in the toolbar. From here, you can simply drag the mind map to the board. Our mind map maker launches with a default parent node, ready and waiting for your first idea.

![Image 55: mindmapping_04_features_product_image_EN_standard_1_1_2x.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/w6r2i5d8q73s/5UUaZJStxYXZ18cN37tals/ab9e08fbd27c64e4e7a4984f851cd6f6/mindmapping_04_features_product_image_EN_standard_1_1_2x.png?fm=webp&q=75)

### 2. Start with a central concept

[](https://miro.com/mind-map/#)

Use the parent (central) node to define your main idea or problem - whether it’s a business challenge, project topic, or creative concept. The node can be easily renamed with a quick double-click. This node will be the anchor point for your mind map as you branch out.

### 3. Add branches

[](https://miro.com/mind-map/#)

Click the plus icon (+) on either side of your node to create child nodes. These represent supporting ideas, subtopics, or related tasks. You can keep branching out to form multiple levels or hierarchy, building a detailed structure around your central concept. You can also use the AI features to help generate and expand ideas quickly.

### 4. Make it yours

[](https://miro.com/mind-map/#)

Personalize your mind map with our color palette and apply different colors to your branches or nodes. You can use color categorization to represent categories, urgency, ownership, status, or anything you choose.

Resize nodes, change text styles, or add icons and emojis to make it even more engaging.

### 5. Organize your mind map

[](https://miro.com/mind-map/#)

Easily keep your mind map aligned using Auto Layout — even when you move branches around or create new nodes. You can drag and reposition branches freely with our mind map maker, and the layout will adapt without breaking the structure - pretty neat!

Mind map FAQs
-------------

### **Is Miro’s mind map creator free?**

Yes, Miro’s mind map creator is 100% free and requires no credit card. After you [sign up](https://miro.com/signup/), you can invite collaborators to your board and start creating a mind map right away.

### **When should I use a mind map?**

Mind maps are great tools for any time you need to organize ideas, thoughts, or concepts and see how they’re connected. They are especially useful for running brainstorming sessions, problem-solving workshops, or note-taking.

### **Can I share my mind map with my team?**

You can share your mind map with your team at any time by using the Share button at the top of your Miro board. You have the option to allow them to view, comment on, or edit your mind map. You can also download your mind map as a PDF and share it as an artifact in other channels.

### **How can I brainstorm with a mind map?**

To brainstorm with a mind map, start with one central idea or problem in the middle of the page or board. Next, establish a few rules, so people know how the session is going to progress.There are a ton of different brainstorming techniques you can use to generate multiple new ideas quickly. As each new idea flows, simply add it to a new node on your virtual mind map.

### **Does Miro have a community or template library for mind mapping?**

Miro is home to a [user community](https://community.miro.com/) where you can seek advice, share guidance, and learn from others. You can also explore mind map templates here or publish your own to help others.

### **Can I tailor mind mapping in Miro to fit my team’s workflow?**

Absolutely. Mind maps in Miro are highly flexible and can adapt to the way your team works. You can design custom templates for recurring mapping sessions, or scale entire processes using Miro Blueprints. Blueprints are preconfigured spaces that include the boards, formats, tools, and templates your team needs, ready to go, so you don’t have to start from scratch. Plus, with AI shortcuts, you can set up one-click actions to streamline tasks like turning a mind map into a project plan or synthesizing ideas into key themes.

How to Choose Free Mind Mapping Software
----------------------------------------

With so many different free mind mapping software solutions available, it can be challenging to make decisions on what free mind mapping software is going to be the best fit for your needs.

As you're shortlisting, trialing, and selecting free mind mapping software, consider the following:

*   **What problem are you trying to solve** - Start by identifying the mind mapping feature gap you're trying to fill to clarify the features and functionality the free mind mapping software needs to provide.
*   **Who will need to use it**- To evaluate cost and requirements, consider who'll be using the software and how many licenses you'll need. You'll need to evaluate if it'll just be the project management professionals, or the whole organization that will require access. When that's clear, it's worth considering if you're prioritizing ease of use for all, or speed for your free mind mapping software power users.
*   **What other tools it needs to work with**- Clarify what tools you're replacing, what tools are staying, and the tools you'll need to integrate with, such as accounting, CRM or HR software. You'll need to decide if the tools will need to integrate together, or alternatively, if you can replace multiple tools with one consolidated free mind mapping tool.
*   **What outcomes are important** - Consider the result that the software needs to deliver to be considered a success. Consider what capability you want to gain, or what you want to improve, and how you will be measuring success. For example, an outcome could be the ability to get greater visibility into performance. You could compare mind mapping features until you’re blue in the face, but if you aren’t thinking about the outcomes you want to drive, you could be wasting a lot of valuable time.
*   **How it would work within your organization**- Consider the software selection alongside your workflows and delivery methodology. Evaluate what's working well, and the areas that are causing issues that need to be addressed. Remember every business is different — don’t assume that because a tool is popular that it'll work in your organization. Additionally, look for software that offers a great feature set in their free version that can scale in functionality as your needs grow. 

Trends in Free Mind Mfapping Software for 2025
----------------------------------------------

As project management professionals in 2025 strive to find the most effective methods for organizing their thoughts and projects, several new trends have emerged to facilitate visual organization and brainstorming. These trends not only demonstrate technological advancements in the field but also underscore the evolving priorities and needs of users:

### Features and Integrations

*   **Enhanced Real-time Collaboration:** The most rapidly evolving feature in mind mapping software is real-time collaboration. Tools now offer more seamless, synchronous editing capabilities, allowing team members to work together on mind maps from different locations. This reflects the growing need for remote teams to brainstorm efficiently, making it easier to create thought webs that capture collective input in real-time.
*   **Deeper Integration with Productivity Tools:** There's a noticeable trend towards deeper integration with other productivity tools, such as project management software, cloud storage, and communication platforms. This functionality facilitates a smoother workflow, allowing users to connect their visual maps directly with their projects and tasks. 
*   **Advanced Visualization Techniques:** There's a trend towards incorporating advanced visualization techniques, such as dynamic charts and graphs, into mind maps. This feature, ideal for tree mind maps, supports more complex data representation and analysis, catering to the needs of users dealing with intricate projects and datasets.

### AI & Automation

*   **AI-Driven Auto-Expansion and Idea Generation**: Some of the best map software now incorporates mind map AI generator features to automatically generate ideas and expand branches within a map. Using mind map AI can help users rapidly develop comprehensive maps, while a mind map generator AI tool suggests related topics or branches, enhancing brainstorming sessions.
*   **Automated Insights and Content Recommendations**: Through machine learning, certain brainstorm apps can provide content recommendations based on detected patterns in the map. This might include links to related resources or personalized insights, streamlining research and guiding users to explore new topics effectively.
*   **Smart Formatting and Layout Adjustments**: Some AI tools can automatically adjust layout and organization within mind maps. This feature is especially useful for large, complex maps, ensuring readability and professional presentation without manual adjustments.
*   **Voice and Text-Based Input for Map Creation**: With advancements in natural language processing, many maps software options now support voice recognition, allowing users to dictate ideas or add notes hands-free. This is ideal for creating maps on-the-go or expanding maps with minimal interruption.

### Evolving Demand

*   **Interactive Presentations:** The ability to convert mind maps into interactive presentations directly within the software is becoming increasingly popular. This functionality enables users to present ideas and project plans in a more engaging and accessible manner. For users who frequently create mind mapping exercises, this interactive capability is particularly beneficial for team sessions, especially in online formats using free network mapping tools.

What Is Free Mind Mapping Software?
-----------------------------------

Free mind mapping software is a digital tool that helps create and organize visual diagrams of ideas at no cost. It allows individuals and teams to brainstorm, plan, and map out information around a central concept or theme using nodes, branches, and hierarchical structures.

Project managers, educators, marketers, and creatives use it to visualize workflows, improve clarity, and generate ideas quickly. Additionally, it is particularly useful for students, freelancers, and small businesses looking to enhance their brainstorming and planning processes without the financial investment required for premium tools.

However, keep in mind that free versions of mind mapping software may have a limit on the number of users or boards available.

How to Create a Mind Map
------------------------

Creating a mind map is a powerful way to organize thoughts, brainstorm ideas, and visualize complex concepts. Here's a guide to how to make a mind map efficiently, from selecting the right mind map app, to organizing and customizing your map.

1.   **Select Your Mind Mapping Tool** - Choose a mind map online software that suits your needs. Consider the features you require, such as collaboration options, ease of use, and available templates. Popular options include simple mind mapping tools for quick setups, AI mind map generators for automated ideas, or more advanced options for detailed mindmapping online. If you're not starting out with a large budget, there are also many free, online mind map platforms you can use. 
2.   **Define Your Central Idea** - Start with a clear and concise central concept. This is the core of your map and should be placed in the center. Tools like a concept map generator AI can help you brainstorm and refine your central theme, making it easier to expand upon. 
3.   **Branch Out Main Topics** - From the central idea, create main branches that represent the primary topics or categories related to your theme. Use a simple mind map template or customize branches in a map editing software to suit your preferences. Try identifying keywords or concise phrases for your main branches to keep them clear and straightforward to maintain a logical flow. 
4.   **Expand with Subtopics and Details** - Add sub-branches to your main topics to break down information into more manageable parts. This step allows you to drill down into specifics, making it an essential component for more complex work, such as mind maps for studying. Utilize mind map bubbles to add layers of detail and keep related ideas grouped together to enhance understanding. 
5.   **Organize and Customize Your Map** - Arrange the branches and sub-branches to optimize readability and flow. Use colors, icons, and styles to differentiate between categories, emphasize key points, and improve readability. Many custom mapping software options include extensive customization features to help tailor your map to your needs.
6.   **Incorporate Additional Features** - Enhance your map with images, links, or attachments if your mapping tools allow it. Some digital map making tools offer integrations with other software, making it easy to connect and expand on your ideas. 
7.   **Review and Refine** - Finally, review your mind map for clarity, completeness, and coherence. Ensure that the structure accurately represents your thoughts and that it serves its intended purpose, whether for a mind mapping workshop, project planning, or simply organizing ideas. Make adjustments as needed using your map creator software to fine-tune your final product.

By following these steps, you can efficiently design mind maps online that are both effective and visually engaging, supporting everything from individual brainstorming sessions to collaborative projects.

Features of Free Mind Mapping Software
--------------------------------------

When selecting free mind mapping software, it is important to understand which features are essential to enhancing creativity, productivity, and collaboration. Here are the key features to look for:

**1. Ease of Use:** A user-friendly interface allows for quick learning and immediate application. This simplicity ensures that more time can be spent on generating and organizing ideas rather than navigating complex software functionalities.

**2. Flexible Mind Map Structures:** The ability to create various structures such as trees, flows, and networks enables users to tailor the visualization to the specific needs of their project or thought process.

**3. Collaboration Tools:** Real-time collaboration features enable teams to work together synchronously, sharing ideas and feedback instantly, which is crucial for dynamic brainstorming sessions and collective idea development.

**4. Integration Capabilities:** Seamless integration with other tools and platforms ensures that mind maps can be easily incorporated into existing workflows, enhancing productivity and facilitating the exchange of information.

**5. Customization Options:** Customization of colors, fonts, and images allows for the creation of visually distinct mind maps, making it easier to differentiate and memorize concepts.

**6. Drag-and-Drop Interface:** This feature simplifies the process of adding, removing, and rearranging ideas, making the brainstorming process more fluid and less time-consuming.

**7. Export and Sharing Options:** Being able to export mind maps in various formats and share them through different channels is essential for presenting ideas and collaborating with others who may not have the same software.

**8. Auto-Save and Cloud Storage:** Automatic saving and cloud-based storage ensure that work is not lost and can be accessed from anywhere, which is critical for continuous workflow and collaboration across different locations.

**9. Keyboard Shortcuts:** Shortcuts enable quicker navigation and manipulation of the mind map, significantly speeding up the brainstorming and organization process.

**10. Scalability:** The software should be capable of handling both small and large mind maps efficiently, allowing for the development of ideas from simple concepts to complex systems without performance issues.

While free versions of mind mapping software offer a strong foundation for visual organization and brainstorming, paid versions often introduce a suite of advanced features that cater to more demanding or specialized needs, such as enhanced collaboration features, advanced integration capabilities, increased storage space, higher security measures, professional customization options, and priority support and training resources.

Benefits of Free Mind Mapping Software
--------------------------------------

Mind mapping software has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing productivity, creativity, and collaboration in both personal and professional settings. Here are five primary benefits of free mind mapping software:

**1. Enhanced Creativity and Idea Generation:** Free mind mapping software facilitates a visual brainstorming process, making it easier to generate new ideas and connections. By visually organizing thoughts, users can uncover creative solutions to problems more efficiently.

**2. Improved Organization and Clarity:** These tools help in organizing complex information in an easy-to-understand visual format. Users can break down large projects into manageable components, making it simpler to see the big picture and focus on details when necessary.

**3. Increased Productivity:** By providing a clear structure for ideas and tasks, free mind mapping software can help users and teams save time on planning and decision-making. This leads to faster project completion and more efficient use of resources.

**4. Enhanced Collaboration:** Many free mind mapping tools offer collaborative features that allow team members to contribute to maps in real-time. This enhances teamwork by ensuring all members have access to the latest updates and can contribute their ideas from anywhere.

**5. Cost Efficiency:** The most obvious benefit is the cost savings. Free mind mapping software allows individuals and organizations to enjoy the benefits of mind mapping without the financial investment, making it accessible to startups, students, and non-profits with limited budgets.

While free versions of mind mapping software offer numerous benefits, upgrading to paid versions can unlock additional features that further enhance productivity and collaboration. Paid versions typically offer more advanced collaboration tools, larger storage capacities, more sophisticated customization options, and higher levels of support and security.

Costs & Pricing for Mind Mapping Software
-----------------------------------------

If you're looking for free software, you clearly understand how important pricing is to the selection process. Overall, mind mapping tools can vary widely in terms of features, scalability, and cost, catering to individuals, small teams, and large organizations alike. However, mind mapping software typically falls into general categories, including free plans.

Free plans are a great starting point. However, it's still important to understand the range of plan options and pricing available to fit different needs and budgets. After all, you might find that a paid plan actually provides more of the features you need at a cost you can afford.

Below is a summary of the typical plan options, including a free version, with their average prices and common features to help you make an informed decision:

### Plan Comparison Table for Mind Mapping Software

| Plan Type | Average Price | Common Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | $0 | Basic mind mapping capabilities, limited templates, cloud storage, collaboration |
| Individual | $5 - $10/month | Advanced mapping features, unlimited templates, more storage, priority support |
| Professional | $10 - $20/month | All Individual features plus collaboration tools, integration options, analytics |
| Team | $20 - $30/user/month | All Professional features plus team management, advanced security, custom branding |
| Enterprise | Custom Pricing | All Team features plus dedicated support, training sessions, SSO, enterprise-grade security |

A breakdown of plan types, costs, and features for mindmap online free software.

When selecting a mind mapping software plan, it is important to consider both the features that meet your current needs and each tool's level of flexibility and ability to scale with you as your projects or organization grows. You may be looking for a free plan now, but it's a good idea to make sure you like the paid plans as well so you don't have to switch tools when you need to upgrade for more advanced features.

Common stages where your company may want to upgrade their pricing plan include:

1.   **Complex Project Management**: When projects become more complex and require advanced features such as task assignments, deadlines, and project tracking, which are usually available in paid plans.
2.   **Collaboration Needs**: As the need for real-time collaboration with a larger team increases, the limitations of the free version in terms of the number of users and collaboration tools may necessitate an upgrade.
3.   **Storage Limitations**: When the volume of mind maps and attached files surpasses the storage capacity offered by the free tier, prompting a need for additional storage space provided in paid versions.
4.   **Integration Requirements**: When there is a need to integrate mind mapping software with other tools and applications used within the company, such as project management, CRM, or productivity software, which often requires a higher-tier subscription.
5.   **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: As the company grows, ensuring data security and compliance with industry regulations becomes more critical, often necessitating a paid plan that offers enhanced security features and compliance support.

Remember, the best choice should balance functionality, ease of use, and cost to ensure that you get the most value from your investment. It's a delicate balance, but with careful research and consideration, it can be achieved.

Free Mind Mapping Software Frequently Asked Questions
-----------------------------------------------------

I’ve answered some common questions about mind mapping and the online tools that you can use for it.

Yes! Microsoft has software that, just like Microsoft Project, is a classic and known by most project managers. This software is called Microsoft Visio and can be purchased as an online solution based on a monthly subscription or a perpetual license.

Visio has an impressive library of elements you can use to build your mind maps and can aid you at any time, regardless of the mind mapping technique you use.

You can grab sticky notes, markers and a whiteboard! At least that’s how this all started. However, if you want to use software for it, you can try any of the tools on this list. Whether it’s a free version or a free trial, they will allow you to build mind maps for free.

However, if you do not want to download software or register for a free trial, you can try using the diagramming tools on Google Slides, Powerpoint, and Keynote.

Absolutely! Many of these free mind mapping tools are quite effective for training purposes.

In general, customer support for free mind mapping software varies by provider. Some offer basic support through FAQs, forums, or email, especially for more common issues. However, the level and immediacy of support might not match that of paid versions, where dedicated, timely assistance is more of a guarantee.

As a project manager, you will likely find that you can resolve some issues through community support or available resources. However, for more complex or urgent needs, the support might be limited. It’s always wise to review the support options before heavily integrating a tool into your workflow.

The security of data in free mind mapping tools can vary significantly. As a project manager, you should know that while many providers prioritize user data security and privacy, the level of security measures may not be as robust as those found in paid versions. It’s crucial to check each tool’s privacy policy and security features, such as data encryption and GDPR compliance, to ensure your and your team’s ideas remain confidential. Always exercise caution with sensitive information, especially when using free tools.

To present a mind map to your colleagues effectively, you can use features that allow you to showcase your mind map designs in an engaging way. Start by creating a mind map online using a brain map maker tool, which can help streamline your brainstorming and organization process. Here’s how you can present your mind map:

1.   **Presentation Mode**: Many brainstorm programs offer a presentation mode that converts your mind map into a slideshow format. This feature lets you navigate through each branch of your map sequentially, highlighting key points without overwhelming your audience.
2.   **Interactive Videos with Talktrack**: Some tools provide the ability to record interactive videos of your mind map presentations with features like Talktrack. This allows you to draw a mind map while narrating your thought process, creating a dynamic and engaging presentation. Talktrack enables you to walk through each section of your mind map, making it easy to share complex ideas through video, perfect for asynchronous communication with your team.
3.   **Idea Board Software Integration**: Integrate your mind map with idea board software to enhance collaboration. This setup allows your team to interact directly with the mind map, providing a space for feedback, additional brainstorming, or even real-time modifications.
4.   **Share or Export Directly:**To ensure easy access and distribution, many mind map software solutions offer multiple sharing and export formats. You can export your mind maps as images, PDFs, or interactive HTML files, making it simple to embed or attach them in emails, project management tools, or documents. For teams that prefer working across different platforms, some tools also support direct sharing links or integrations with cloud storage solutions, so colleagues can access and view the latest version. Additionally, mind map graphic organizers can be exported in formats compatible with other software, maximizing their usability and reach across different contexts and applications.

Yes, many free mind mapping tools work well for team training. You can use them to visually outline processes, brainstorm ideas together, or map out training content in a way that’s easy to follow.

If you are interested in training a team using mind mapping tools, look for tools that allow real-time collaboration and template sharing, so your team can build and update maps together. Free plans may limit the number of users or features, but for small to mid-sized teams, they often provide enough flexibility for effective sessions.

Tools like MindMeister and Miro offer strong integrations with popular project management platforms such as Trello, Asana, and ClickUp. These integrations let your team turn mind maps into action items, sync tasks, and streamline workflows without manual copying.

However, check each tool’s integration list before choosing as some free tiers include basic connections. Deeper integrations might require a paid plan.

Yes, most free mind mapping tools let you export your maps as PDF or image files. Some, like Mindomo and Coggle, also offer options to export in formats like Word, Excel, or CSV for easier editing or sharing with stakeholders.

PDF exports keep your visuals intact for presentations, while Excel/CSV exports help you repurpose map data into spreadsheets or reports. Double-check export options on the free plan, as advanced features may require an upgrade.

Title: Simple Mindmap

Markdown Content:
### What is Simple Mind Map?

Simple mind map is the best free mind mapping tool with no signup required. Works on all devices allowing you to create online mind maps across your desktop, phone (iPhone and Android) or tablet (iPad). I created this because all the other tools were too clunky, I just wanted to make a mind map online, quickly, and without needing to signup.

### Feedback

If you've used the tool and have any feedback, I'd love to hear it at _contact(at)joshuaj.co.uk_. Although I can't dedicate loads of time to the tool, I always want to improve it to make it the best, completely free mindmap tool by adding new features and squashing bugs.
